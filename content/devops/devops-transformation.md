> “We’ve adopted DevOps.”  
That’s what a CIO told me at a client meeting a few years ago. Yet their deployment process still required a two-week CAB approval, manual Excel checklists, and downtime windows negotiated weeks in advance.  

This gap between **what DevOps was meant to be** and **how it’s often practiced** is why the conversation around DevOps is still relevant in 2025.

## The Origins of DevOps

DevOps didn’t appear out of thin air.  
- In **2001**, Agile broke down walls between business and developers — but left Operations behind.  
- In **2009**, at the Velocity Conference, Patrick Debois coined *DevOps* as a way to bridge the gap.  
- The early principles? **Collaboration, automation, measurement, sharing** (the CALMS model).  

The goal was simple: stop throwing code over the wall, and make delivery a shared responsibility.

## The Evolution

1. **Phase 1: Tooling Obsession (2010–2015)**  
   Jenkins pipelines, Puppet, Chef. Organisations equated “doing DevOps” with installing a CI server.  

2. **Phase 2: Cloud Native & Containers (2015–2020)**  
   Docker, Kubernetes, Infrastructure-as-Code. Ops teams shifted from racking servers to managing clusters.  

3. **Phase 3: Platform Engineering & SRE (2020–today)**  
   Internal developer platforms, golden paths, GitOps, and SRE practices.  
   The focus shifted from individual pipelines to **platforms enabling scale**.  

Yet, in parallel, many companies remain frozen in Phase 0 — still driven by ticket queues, silos, and outdated governance.

## The Reality in Organisations

Fifteen years after the first DevOps Days, I still see patterns like:
- A “DevOps team” treated as a silo, separate from developers.  
- Cloud adoption, but DNS changes require manual tickets.  
- CI/CD pipelines built, but no monitoring, no rollback, no ownership.  
- Security and compliance bolted on at the end, not integrated from the start.  

The most common misunderstanding: **DevOps = tools**.  
But DevOps is first and foremost a *cultural and organisational shift*. Tools only amplify the culture you already have.

## Lessons From the Trenches

From my own projects, a few recurring lessons stand out:

- **Culture eats tooling for breakfast.**  
  I’ve seen companies migrate to Kubernetes but still hold Friday 2 AM release windows.  

- **Self-service beats centralisation.**  
  Ticket-driven “Ops bottlenecks” don’t scale. Teams thrive when platforms give developers the autonomy to deploy, monitor, and roll back safely.  

- **Transformation isn’t a project, it’s a journey.**  
  Many organisations treat DevOps like a one-time migration. In reality, it’s continuous improvement, learning, and adaptation.

## What True DevOps Transformation Looks Like

The organisations that *get it right* share a few traits:

- Developers own code **end-to-end** — from commit to production.  
- **Self-service platforms** enable teams without making Ops gatekeepers.  
- Testing, security, and compliance are **automated into the pipeline**.  
- Reliability is measured and improved using **SLOs, error budgets, and feedback loops**.  
- Leadership fosters a **culture of trust, learning, and accountability**.  

This isn’t about chasing the next shiny tool. It’s about building a system where people, process, and technology align.

## Closing Thoughts

DevOps started as a rebellion against silos. Fifteen years later, many organisations still operate as if nothing has changed. The future isn’t about more YAML files or new orchestrators — it’s about culture, ownership, and ways of working.  

> The hardest part of DevOps has never been the pipelines.  
> It’s always been the people.  

In the coming posts, I’ll dig deeper into specific practices — from **CI/CD pipelines that actually deliver** to **building internal developer platforms that teams love**. But first, we have to face the truth: most of us are still only scratching the surface of real DevOps transformation.
