I’m **Tarik Miri**, a software architect and cloud transformation leader passionate about scaling systems, modernizing software, and enabling engineering teams to deliver at their best.

With over a decade of experience across Europe and MENA, I’ve worked at the intersection of technology and strategy—leading large-scale transformations in cloud adoption, .NET modernization, DevOps practices, and enterprise architecture. My background spans both hands-on engineering and leadership roles, where I’ve helped organizations design resilient architectures, streamline operations, and build high-performing teams.

I created **MiricleReach** to share lessons learned in my journey and to create a space for open, practical discussion. The blog is structured around four pillars:

- **Cloud Architecture at Scale** – strategies for building resilient, high-performance systems.  
- **Software Modernization** – evolving legacy applications into modern, cloud-native platforms.  
- **DevOps & Developer Experience (DevEx)** – advancing delivery with GitOps, automation, and developer-centric platforms.  
- **Engineering Leadership** – scaling teams, driving excellence, and leading with impact.  

Technology isn’t just about tools—it’s about people, impact, and creating systems that last. I’m especially passionate about the opportunities emerging in high-growth regions like Dubai and the wider MENA, where digital transformation is reshaping industries at an incredible pace.
