Welcome to **MiricleReach** — my personal space for field-tested lessons at the intersection of cloud, software, DevOps, and engineering leadership.  

I’m **Tarik Miri**, a Cloud and Software Transformation Leader with more than a decade of experience helping teams scale systems and organisations across industries and time zones.  

Here I share the patterns that work, the traps that slow teams down, and the practical tools you can apply to your own environment.  

You’ll find articles on:  
- Designing cloud platforms that make the secure path the easy path.  
- Building software that evolves without costly rewrites.  
- Modernising delivery with DevOps practices that actually scale.  
- Growing engineering teams without multiplying chaos.  

The goal is simple: to help you design technology and organisations that move faster, stay safer, and deliver lasting value.
